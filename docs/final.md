# Overview:

We want to create an inventory tracker for the Student Care Supply Closets that is managed by the Dean of Students Office. The Student Care Supply Closets provides free toiletries and household items for students struggling economically. There is currently no way for students to know if they have the items they need in stock. So we want to create an inventory tracker that will let students know what is currently available. Additionally, we want to create a form for someone to ask how much they need for each item. 

Currently, the Supply Closet uses a Microsoft form to handle any requests. So, we wanted to automate this process for them to a certain degree and also make a user-friendly interface for people who are using this resource. The result is our website, Klosested Supply.

# Database

We implemented our database `supply` with MongoDB. It has three collections: `items`, `users`, and `orders`.

## `items`

The `items` collection is used store the current inventory of Kloseted Supply.

Each `Item` document has the following format:
```json
{    
    id: Integer, //Item's identification number
    name: String, //Item's name
    stock: Integer, //Item's stock in inventory
    description: String, //Item's description
    tags: Array<String>,  //Item's tags
    image: String  //Filename of Item's image
}
```

## `users` 
The `users` collection is used to store all the users of the website.

Each `User` document has the following format:
```json
{
    name: String, //User's name
    password: String, //User's password
    cart: Array<Item> //User's cart
}
```

## `orders` 
The `orders` collection is used to store all the orders placed on the website.

Each `Order` document has the following format:
```json
{
    username: String, //Name of user who placed the order
    timestamp: Date, //Time and date user placed the order
    items: Array<Item> //The items the user ordered
}
```

# URL Routes/Mappings

## User endpoints
- `/register`: Registers a new user
- `/private`: TBD
## Cart endpoints
For all cart endpoints, authentication of the user is required
- `/getCart`: Gets the user's cart
- `/addItemCart`: Adds the given item to the user's cart
- `/incrementItemCart`: Increments the quantity of the given item in the user's cart
- `/decrementItemCart`: Decrements the quantity of the given item in the user's cart
- `/deleteItem`: Deletes the given item from the user's cart
- `/emptyCart`: Deletes all items from the user's cart
## Item endpoints
## Order endpoints


# Authentication/Authorization:
> A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.

# Division of Labor

### Rajasi: 
For the first milestone, I made the Map page and the Header/Navigation bar for the website. I also added the Cart funtionality with the dropdown and worked on the markdown file. For the second milestone, I worked on the cart implementation and worked on mostly the server side setting up the endpoints. I also worked on deploying the site on Heroku and creating the markdown templates.

### Grace: 
For the first milestone, I made the product page (called 'form' on the site) which included the grid of products and a prototype of an image that will appear when hovering over a product word. Also made filter/search area to filter through the grid of items. For the second milestone, I worked on changing the product/form page into JS and mainly worked on additional features such as filtering the products and creating a pop out image for each product.

### Isi: 
For the first milestone, I made the checkout page and helped with the general layout and CSS and of the website. For the second milestone, I standardized the custom datatypes for `User`s, `Cart`s, and `Item`s and implemented checkout functionality.

### Aryan: 
For the first milestone, I made the login page as well as the sign up page. For the second milestone, I implemented the login and signup pages using JS, allowing the user to both register a new account and log in to access their cart and make orders. I also edited each page to allow the user to log out from any page.


# Conclusion

This project was definitely a fun one to do but required a lot of effort. One of the major things we learned through this was team work and collaboration. All four of us were pair programming most of the time for this project using LiveShare in VScode. This allowed us to avoid any merge conflicts on Git and allowed us to work together as a team. 

Since we were learning things in class in a way that we had to change up things in a project again and again, it led to slight confusion and disorganization. But in the end we made things work and compatible.

We would have loved to know about authentication and database stuff beforehand beucause later it came to a point where we were rewriting a lot of the code to have it compatible with these things.
