# Innovative Idea 

We want to create an inventory tracker for the Student Care Supply Closets that is managed by the Dean of Students Office. The Student Care Supply Closets provides free toiletries and household items for students struggling economically. There is currently no way for students to know if they have the items they need in stock. So we want to create an inventory tracker that will let students know what is currently available. Additionally, we want to create a form for someone to ask how much they need for each item. 

This relates to other existing applications through the existence of a form that is going to be filled out as if someone was shopping for it. We could not think of or find an existing public application similar to inventory tracking.

# Important Components 
1. The Data. We hope to get in contact with the Dean of Students Office to see if they have the data available for us to take. If not we might ask them to create a spreadsheet that they can update as they see fit and we can pull that data from there.
2. The Form. This is one of the main components so a student is able to see the inventory and order what they need. This will be a form that asks for several inputs and we will maintain that data to give to the Student Supply Closet. Inputs, buttons, and so on.
3. Inventory Tracking. We will take the data and create a grid or some type of spreadsheet-looking thing that will let users immediately see what is available. 
4. Recommendations. If a user wants an item that is not currently available, we want to give them recommendations of a different brand of the product that they might be able to get instead.
5. A map. They will call the user when they can pick stuff up. We want to create a map where the pickup location will be shown. The Student Care Supply Closet team is also partnering with the Project Period UMass Amherst, a student organization to end period poverty by promoting menstrual equity and providing free menstrual products for everyone! There are several locations around campus where you can find free menstrual products and we want to create an interactive map to show the locations.
